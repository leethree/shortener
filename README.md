# A URL Shortener

> An example app of Relay Modern and others

## Frameworks

- Framework: [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)
- Client: [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Rebass](https://jxnblk.com/rebass/)
- Schema: [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) + [Relay](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js)
- Server: [Express-GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)
- Database: [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)

Shortened URLs are generated using [hashids](https://hashids.org/).

## Get Started

### Install

### Build

Generate a GraphQL schema file:

The API server can be accessed at <http://localhost:3000>. And you can visit
the GraphiQL console at <http://localhost:3000/graphql>.

Alongside the API server, start WebPack development server:

```
yarn start
```

The Web app can be accessed at <http://localhost:8080>.

### Build and Run Production Server

Build static resources:

```
yarn build
```

Start server in production mode:

NODE_ENV=production yarn serve
```

## Lint and Testing
